    <h1>SFC Cabrera, Welcome to my forms Page</h1>
    <p>
        I want to thank you for taking the time to review my work as well as the opportunity to work with your team. <br>
        Below are a few forms that I have been working on. I plan on continuing work on this project to make it a sort of portfolio site.
    </p>
    <p><a href="{{ url_for('form') }}">Basic Form</a></p>
    <p><a href="{{ url_for('name_form_green_eggs') }}">Story Time!</a></p>
